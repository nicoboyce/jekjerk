You're looking at the demo of JekJerk, a tabloid style Jekyll-Now based template for Jekyll. Click on this story to read more about how the template works.

This is the latest post in the news category. The latest post always is in the top position within each category on the front page and the featured image for the category is taken from the latest post also. This is all done in Liquid so there's minimal faff - just writing to worry about.

The front page takes the category names and headers from the [_config.yml file](https://github.com/nicoboyce/nicoboyce.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) and so there's less work to do when you fork this template site and start building your own - no hardcoded links to hunt down and correct.

The template has responsive CSS and repositions content in a logical way according to screen size. Essentially, each front page category section becomes a one column block. Give it a go.

This is an early version and I wouldn't say it's ready for use yet if you're not happy to dive in to my css etc and fix bits and pieces I haven't finished working on.

Feel free to [email me](nico@bluegf.com) with any ideas or feedback. Cheers!
