Firstly, be aware that this is merely version {{ jjversion }} and there is a lot more I plan to do before I'm happy with recommending this template to beginners. However, if you're feeling brave...

Fork [this repo](https://github.com/nicoboyce/nicoboyce.github.io) and fill in all the appropriate information in the _config.yml file.

Familiarise yourself with the structure - I've tried to make it as obvious as possible what information is used where but it will be worth taking a moment to be sure. Read the [Jekyll-Now readme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md) for additional information.
