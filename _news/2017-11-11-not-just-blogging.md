Firstly, be aware that this is merely version {{ site.jjversion }} and there is a lot more I plan to do before I'm happy with recommending this template to beginners. However, if you're feeling brave...

Fork [this repo](https://github.com/nicoboyce/nicoboyce.github.io) and fill in all the appropriate information in the _config.yml file.

Familiarise yourself with the structure - I've tried to make it as obvious as possible what information is used where but it will be worth taking a moment to be sure. Read the [Jekyll-Now readme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md) for additional information.

Rename your collections (both the directories and in the _config.yml) and the navigation links and the front page content will update accordingly. Make sure to put your posts in the correct collection folders and to name the collection in the yaml front matter of each post.
